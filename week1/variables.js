/*this example illustrates that js assigns variable types dynamically according 
to the value assigned to it.

(this syntax is used to write multiline comments in js)
*/

var a = 10; //javascript Number
var b = 10e10 // this is also a Number
var c = "waleed" //javascript string
var d = true //javascript boolean
var e = null //javascript null used to show and unintentional empty delaration
var f = undefined //used to show that the variable is delared but not given the value yet
var g = //used to show illegal mathematical operation


    //in the above examples i have included semicolon and excluded it as well 
    //semicolon is optional in js but it is a good practice to write it so that you don't forget that in other languages

    //to print this on the terminal we can use 
    console.log(a, b, c, d) //outputs 10 100000000000 waleed true


//following code shows difference between var and let
